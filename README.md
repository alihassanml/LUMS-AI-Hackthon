# LUMS AI Hackathon: Magic Wand Project 🪄

Welcome to the **Magic Wand Project**, developed as part of the **LUMS AI Hackathon**! 🚀 Our innovative solution bridges the gap between gesture recognition and real-time AI-powered interaction, delivering a unique and engaging user experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Magic Wand project leverages **Streamlit** and **Groq API** to create an intuitive and interactive application for gesture-based controls. This AI-driven system can detect and classify hand gestures in real time, enabling seamless integration with various applications.

### Key Highlights:
- Utilized **LSTMs** and **GRUs** for handling sequential data and long-term dependencies.
- Achieved **89% accuracy** on Kaggle, securing **3rd place** on the leaderboard.
- Designed with an easy-to-use interface powered by **Streamlit** for rapid deployment.
- Integrated **Groq API** for high-performance model inference.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Classify hand gestures with precision.
- **Streamlined UI**: User-friendly interface for interaction and visualization.
- **Robust Model**: Trained on 100-frame sequences using advanced deep learning techniques.
- **Scalable Design**: Built for adaptability across various use cases.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for a responsive and interactive UI.
- **Backend**: Python with integration of the **Groq API** for high-performance model serving.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras for gesture recognition models.
- **Deployment**: Scalable architecture ready for deployment in production.
